# Recommender-Project

Recommender Project done by the three musketeers [@GaoMo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gao-mo/), [@JianmingGeng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgeng99/), and [@MuchanLi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muchan-li-989703227/).
We aim to build one fully end-to-end recipe recommender system, from early stages of data wrangling all the way to model deployment, utilizing industry-level tools and practices.
